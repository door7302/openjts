# Juniper Telemetry Stack - aka. JTS
This is a repo to build from scratch a Telemetry stack to monitor any Juniper Routing Devices. 

This stack has the codename "JTS" which stands for Juniper Telemetry Stack 

This stack relies on OpenSource software solutions such as **Telegraf** for collecting gNMI Telemetry state data and pre-processing the data, **InfluxDB** as a Time Series Database to store data, **Kapacitor** to aggregate and perform Alarming and finally **Grafana** to display contents. A specific piece of software developed by Juniper and called **JTSO**, which stands for JTS Orchestrator, is also present in the stack (Dev. in **GOLANG**). This piece of software developed by TME AWAN Team has 2 main roles: the first one is to manage the Stack (provision routers IP, select the pre shipped profils) and on the other hands provide an Enricher tool to enrich on-the-fly telemetry data for better visualization and aggregation).  

JTS is pre-filled with templates of configuration and dashbords for typical use cases. Those profiles are tgz files store in compose/jso/profiles directory 

JTS relies on Docker Compose to deploy in one command this stack. Please be sure you have done all the prerequisites before.

JTS has only been validated for Ubuntu/Debian Host OS. 

{- Notice: Currently JTS uses a specific build of Telegraf which offers more functionalities (dev. by Juniper). Juniper will continue to push these enhancements to the official Telegraf project -}

## Prerequisites

### Install Docker & compose plugin

https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

```shell
sudo umask 022

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg

sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

echo "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
````

Then login first time (requiered for downloading from docker hub):

```shell
docker login --username door7302
```

And test: 

```shell
docker run hello-world
````

## Installation of JTS

From root - create a username openjts 

```shell
adduser openjts
# add openjts as sudoer 
adduser openjts sudo  
```

Now, switch to openjts user
```shell
su openjts
```

Just clone the git repo locally. 

```shell
# In any directory 
sudo mkdir JTS
cd JTS

sudo git clone https://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@github.com/door7302/openjts.git .
```

## Configuration of JTS 

### Prefer HTTPS ? 

If you want to use HTTPs for JTSO and Grafane you may use self signed certificate:

```shell
#Go to the jtso/cert directpory 
cd ./compose/jtso/cert 

sudo openssl genrsa -aes256 -passout pass:gsahdg -out server.pass.key 4096

sudo openssl rsa -passin pass:gsahdg -in server.pass.key -out server.key

sudo rm server.pass.key

sudo openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

sudo openssl x509 -req -sha256 -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
```

Now, edit the JTSO config file and enable JTSO HTTPS (set to true)

```shell
sudo vi ./compose/jtso/config.yml
/.../
modules:
  portal:
    https: true
    server_crt: "server.crt"
    server_key: "server.key"
/.../
```

Now copy server.key & server.crt into ./compose/grafana/cert 

```shell
cd ./compose/jtso/cert 
sudo cp server.* ../../grafana/cert
```
Finally, update the ./compose/grafana/grafana.ini config file like that:

```shell
sudo vi ./compose/grafana/grafana.ini 
[server]
# Protocol (http, https, h2, socket)
protocol = https

# https certs & key file
cert_file = /tmp/server.crt
cert_key = /tmp/server.key
/.../
```

### Incoming ports to open 

By default, the JTSO portal listen to TCP port 80 and Grafana to TCP 8080. You can also change the default JTSO & Grafana public facing port (see below) by editing ./compose/.env file before starting the stack.

You can change public ports facing by editing the **.env**  file. Two ports are exposed:
- GRAFANA_PORT: the port used to reach the Grafana portal - default is 8080
- JTSO_PORT: the port used to reach the JTSO portal  - default is 80

```shell
# If needed, You can change public ports facing by editing the .env file 
cat .env
GRAFANA_PORT=8080
JTSO_PORT=80
```

If you change the GRAFANA public facing port you also need to update the jtso config.yml with the same port, like that:

```shell
sudo vi ./compose/jtso/config.yml
/.../
modules:
  grafana:
    port: 8080
/.../
```

### Outgoing ports to open

OpenJTS will establish TCP sessions with your routing devices for reaching the following network services:
- Netconf - default is TCP port 830
- gNMI - default is TCP 9339

If needed you can change these ports. 

#### Netconf port

By default OpenJTS uses the Netconf port 830. If you want to change this port you need to edit the jtso config file:

```shell
sudo vi ./compose/jtso/config.yml
/.../
protocols:
  netconf:
    port: 9339
/.../
```

#### gNMI port

By default OpenJTS uses the gRPC port 9339. If you want to change this port you need to edit the jtso config file:

```shell
sudo vi ./compose/jtso/config.yml
/.../
protocols:
  gnmi:
    port: 9339
/.../
```

### gNMI with TLS 

If you want to use SSL for gNMI (**global to all routers**) you need first to create a self signed CA: **Keep the naming convention**

```shell
cd ./compose/telegraf/cert
sudo openssl genrsa -out RootCA.key 2048
sudo openssl req -x509 -new -key RootCA.key -days 3650 -out RootCA.crt
```

**(Optionnal)** Now, create and sign telegraf certificates if needed:

```shell
sudo openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048 
sudo openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr
sudo openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA RootCA.crt -CAkey RootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365

```

And finally for each router - repeat these following task - to create and sign the router certificate:

```shell
sudo openssl genrsa -out router.key 2048 
sudo openssl req -new -key router.key -out router.csr
sudo openssl x509 -req -in router.csr -CA RootCA.crt -CAkey RootCA.key -CAcreateserial -out router.crt -days 365
cat router.crt router.key > router.pem
```

Upload to the router the **router.pem**, **client.crt** and **RootCA.crt** into one router folder (i.e. /var/tmp), and do this configuration on each router:

```junos
edit exclusive
set security pki ca-profile ca1 ca-identity caid1
set security certificates local lcert load-key-file /var/tmp/router.pem
commit and-quit
request security pki ca-certificate load ca-profile ca1 filename /var/tmp/RootCA.crt
```

### Configure your network devices

For each routing device apply these config lines:

```junos
edit exclusive

# Netconf User
set system login user netconf_user class super-user
set system login user netconf_user authentication encrypted-password “”

#gNMI User 
set system login user gnmi_user class super-user
set system login user gnmi_user authentication encrypted-password “”

# Clear Text gRPC
set system services extension-service request-response grpc clear-text port 9339
set system services extension-service request-response grpc max-connections 8
set system services extension-service request-response grpc skip-authentication

# Or TLS encryption gRPC
set system services extension-service request-response grpc ssl port 9339
set system services extension-service request-response grpc ssl local-certificate lcert
# Optional mutual authentication 
set system services extension-service request-response grpc ssl mutual-authentication certificate-authority ca1
set system services extension-service request-response grpc ssl mutual-authentication client-certificate-request require-certificate-and-verify

# Netconf
set system services netconf ssh
set system services netconf rfc-compliant #optional

commit and-quit
```

## Start JTS 

To start the JTS you just need to deploy each docker by using **docker compose up** command. 

You can start the OpenJTS with the following command:

{- The first time you bring up the stack, it may take slightly more time as we need to build on-the-fly Telegraf -} 

```shell 
# Bring up the stack with one Telegraf Instance
sudo docker compose up -d  
```

You may want to check if dockers are up and running. For that, just issue the following command:

```shell
sudo docker compose ps
```

Note: Telegraf docker(s) are only started if there is at least one router assigned to the Telegraf instance. 

## JTS logs 

JTS writes its logs into **/var/log/jtso.log**

## Stop JTS

To stop the JTS just issue the following command:

```shell
# Shutdown the stack
sudo docker compose down
```

## Update the JTSO 

To update the JTSO image 

```shell
# Shutdown the stack
sudo docker compose down

# remove the current image 
sudo docker image rm compose-jtso 

# restart the stack 
sudo docker compose up -d  
```

# Manage the stack via JTSO

Once launched you should have access to the JTSO portal (http or https). Open a web browser and open the portal: **http(s)://your-ip:your-port/index.html**
You should have access to this page - this one provide the state of the OpenJTS.

## Configure credentials

Go to the menu **"Credentials"**

First step is to fill the Netconf/gNMI user/pwd you configured on your routing devices. Remember, the credentials are the same for all routers. 
You can also indicate to the stack that you want to use TLS/SSL for gNMI. Once again this is for all routing devices. It means either you'll use TLS for all routers or you'll use clear text mode for all devices. By default TLS is disabled, skip-verify is enabled and client-side TLS authentication is disabled.

## Configure your inventory

Go to the menu **"Routers"**

Here you must fill for each router:
- a unique short name (internal use only)
- the IP or hostname of the remote device 

Automatically, the JTSO will open a Netconf session to the device to retrieve some facts like the chassis model & version.

## Navigate in the profiles DOC

Go to the menu **"DOC"**

Here you will find some information regarding the profiles:
- Which sensors/counters used to build the profile 
- Some detail about the config files (telegraf, kapacitor) 
- The Dashboards shipped with the profile 

![jtso4.png](./img/jtso4.png)

## Assign router to profile(s)

Go to the menu **"Profiles"**

Here you can assign/remove one or several profiles to a given router. Each time you add/remove a router in this page, the stack will be re-configured automatically.

## Use Grafana Dashboard(s)

Go to the menu **"Grafana"**

By clicking on the Grafana menu you will have directly access to the Grafana portal.
