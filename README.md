# Juniper Telemetry Stack - aka. JTS

![jts.png](./img/logo-med.png)

## Disclaimer

This project is a "side time project" supported in 'best-effor' :) and I'm not a software developper, so be indulgent with me :). 

## SUPPORTED USE CASES (Profiles)

Today OpenJTS supports: 

- **HEALTH PROFILE**: Monitoring the health of the router - many environmental data.
- **TRAFFIC PROFILE**: Monitoring of traffic and traffic error including queue drops, VoQ, Queue depth (depends on HW), and many other traffic KPI for Physical and Logical interfaces.
- **BGP PROFILE**: BGP statistics per neighbor, family, peer-group routing statistics, including on-change session events.
- **DDOS PROFILE**: Monitoring of the DDOS Protection statistics 
- **FILTER PROFILE**: Monitoring of all your firewall filter counters and policers at PFE and port levels. 
- **POWER PROFILE**: Monitoring of the power consumption of each active chassis components. Include temperature and Fan speed monitoring. Include an aggregated view. 
- **OPTIC PROFILE**: Moniroting of the optic KPIs: level, alarms. Support OTN optics. ZR/ZR+ dedicated dashboard. 
- **SRMPLS PROFILE**: Monitoring of SR MPLS traffic: per interface and per label (SID)

> Note: Depending the platform and the version you may have access to more of less information. Also, some profiles are not supported on some PF/Version. Please refer to the "doc" menu from the JTSO portal. 

> Note 2: Some statistics requiere specific device configuration.

## Quick Overview

Embark on a journey to discover and embrace Juniper Telemetry solution with this simple project. Designed for effortless adoption, this all-in-one tool is here to demystify gRPC Telemetry on Juniper routing products. We currently support PTX 10K, MX (vMX, Neo and 10K platforms) & ACX 7K platforms. Junos/EVO 20.1 and onwards are supported.

Feel free to open issue if you experience some troubles for a given HW or SW version. The profiles have been tested with recent Junos releases so some older versions may use different "counters" naming - especially when OpenConfig models are used. I can easily patch a profile, in minutes, without touching the code. Moreover, if you want I develop a new profile for a new use case, don't hesitate to also open an issue. 

This project is made around 3 main repos:

- OpenJTS: https://github.com/door7302/openjts - provides the infra for deplying the stack and includes all theh profiles
- JTSO: https://github.com/door7302/jtso - the source code of the jtso component 
- JTS Telegraf: https://github.com/door7302/jts_telegraf - a fork of the telegraf project which includes several plugins and enhancements for OpenJTS. 

All comments, remarks, ideas are welcome. you can reach out to me here: **door7302@gmail.com**

## Presentation 

This is a repo to build from scratch a Telemetry stack to monitor any Juniper Routing Devices. 

This stack has the codename "JTS" which stands for Juniper Telemetry Stack 

This stack relies on OpenSource software solutions such as **Telegraf** for collecting gNMI Telemetry state data (it also supports Netconf input plugin for data not yet available through Telemetry) and pre-processing the data, **InfluxDB** as a Time Series Database to store data, **Kapacitor** to aggregate and perform Alarming and finally **Grafana** to display contents. A specific piece of software developed by Juniper and called **JTSO**, which stands for JTS Orchestrator, is also present in the stack (Dev. in **GOLANG**). This piece of software developed by TME AWAN Team has 2 main roles: the first one is to manage the Stack (provision routers IP, select the pre shipped profils) and on the other hands provide an Enricher tool to enrich on-the-fly telemetry data for better visualization and aggregation).  

JTS is pre-filled with templates of configuration and dashbords for typical use cases. Those profiles are tgz files store in **compose/jso/profiles directory** 

JTS relies on Docker Compose to deploy in one command this stack. Please be sure you have done all the prerequisites before.

JTS has only been validated for Ubuntu/Debian Host OS. 

{- Notice: Currently JTS uses a specific build of Telegraf which offers more functionalities (dev. by Juniper). Juniper will continue to push these enhancements to the official Telegraf project -}
