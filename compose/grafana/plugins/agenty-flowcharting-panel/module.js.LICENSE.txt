*        @text - String; text to beatufy;
*        @indent_pattern - Integer | String;
*                Integer:  number of white spaces;
*                String:   character string to visualize indentation ( can also be a set of white spaces )
*   Minify
*
*        vkbeautify.xmlmin(text [,preserve_comments]);
*        vkbeautify.jsonmin(text);

*        @text - String; text to minify;

*                Set this flag to true to prevent removing comments from @text ( minxml and mincss functions only. )
*
*   Examples:
*        vkbeautify.xml(text); // pretty print XML
*        vkbeautify.json(text, 4 ); // pretty print JSON
*        vkbeautify.css(text, '. . . .'); // pretty print CSS
*        vkbeautify.sql(text, '----'); // pretty print SQL
*
*        vkbeautify.xmlmin(text, true);// minify XML, preserve comments
*        vkbeautify.jsonmin(text);// minify JSON
*        vkbeautify.cssmin(text);// minify CSS, remove comments ( default )
*        vkbeautify.sqlmin(text);// minify SQL
